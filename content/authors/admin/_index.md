I am a Deaf researcher specializing in music accessiility and human-computer interaction. My research forcuses on developing vibrotactile feedback systems that support accurate singing timing for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals. By integrating signal processing, machine learning, and embedded systems design, I aim to achieve precise synchronization between audio and vibrotactile stimuli. In addition, I explore **personalized optimization** of vibrotactile timing to accommodate individual perceptual differences. Through this work, I strive to realize **music accessibility that is understandable and meaningful** for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing people—especially those inspired to sing.
