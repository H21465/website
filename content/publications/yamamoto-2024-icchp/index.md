abstract: "Access to music for people who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing (D/HoH) includes
  the instrumental portion and the lyrics. While closed captioning can provide the
  lyrics in text format, it does not necessarily provide accurate timing of the lyrics
  with the instrumental portion. This study aims to clarify how vibrotactile stimuli
  affect understanding the onset timing of song lyrics for D/HoH people. To achieve
  this goal, we developed a system called VIBES: VIBrotactile Engagement for Songs
  that simultaneously provides music and vibration playback as an iPhone app. Unlike
  other vibrotactile systems for music, which focus primarily on the percussion/beat
  or frequencies of the instrumental portions, VIBES presents vibrations for the timing
  of vocal utterances, syllable by syllable. We conducted a study with 10 participants
  to determine the system's effectiveness by comparing the understanding of lyric
  timing with vibration and sound only. Statistically, one of the four songs in the
  experiment showed significant differences, where understanding lyric timing with
  vibration is better than in sound-only conditions. Two songs revealed the opposite
  results, and the other showed no differences between the two conditions. Although
  these results were unexpected, we obtained several findings to make the next version
  of VIBES, such as the frequency of vibrations."
