 abstract = {Our research question aims to clarify why people who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) enjoy singing. In this paper, as the first step toward answering the research question, we conducted a group interview with four DHH participants and analyzed their data using inductive coding to derive three overarching themes and categories and codes under each of them. One theme, Singing Background, revealed that all four participants sing on a daily basis. Songs used in Vocaloid, a singing synthesizer; anime; and movies are triggers that prompt our participants to sing and empathize with the lyrics. The theme Situations for Singing clarified that they sing 10 or 20 songs at karaoke bars and practice the songs repeatedly every day. The theme of Changes Felt through Singing indicated that the scores given by a karaoke machine, the natural swaying of the body to the rhythm, improving singing techniques, and singing along in the atmosphere created by the lyrics let them know their singing has improved and helps them to enjoy singing. Namely, the objective evaluations given by karaoke scores, the subjective evaluation of feelings within their bodies, and a deeper understanding of the lyrics and music achieved by singing the same songs repeatedly were the factors that made them find singing enjoyable.},
